"Consumer Price Index, San Francisco Area â€” February 2020",,,
"Area prices were up 0.9 percent over the past two months, up 2.9 percent from a year ago",,,
"Prices in the San Francisco area, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U),",,,
"advanced 0.9 percent for the two months ending in February 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics",,,
reported today. (See table A.) Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations Richard Holden noted that the,,,
February increase was influenced by higher prices for shelter and apparel. (Data in this report are not,,,
"seasonally adjusted. Accordingly, month-to-month changes may reflect seasonal influences.)",,,
"Over the last 12 months, the CPI-U increased 2.9 percent. (See chart 1 and table A.) The index for all items",,,
less food and energy advanced 2.8 percent over the year. Food prices rose 3.5 percent. Energy prices increased,,,
"4.0 percent, largely the result of an increase in the price of electricity. (See table 1.)",,,
Food,,,,,,,,,,
Food prices increased 1.4 percent for the two months ending in February. (See table 1.) Prices for food away,,,,,,,,,,
"from home increased 2.7 percent, but prices for food at home edged up 0.1 percent for the same period.",,,,,,,,,,
"Over the year, food prices rose 3.5 percent. Prices for food way from home moved up 6.3 percent since a year",,,,,,,,,,
"ago, and prices for food at home increased 0.5 percent.",,,,,,,,,,
Energy,,,,,,,,,,
The energy index decreased 0.8 percent for the two months ending in February. The decrease was mainly due,,,,,,,,,,
"to lower prices for gasoline (-4.1 percent). Prices for natural gas service advanced 3.1 percent, and prices for",,,,,,,,,,
electricity rose 2.7 percent for the same period.,,,,,,,,,,
"Energy prices increased 4.0 percent over the year, largely due to higher prices for electricity (11.2 percent).",,,,,,,,,,
"Prices paid for natural gas service increased 3.3 percent, but prices for gasoline edged down 0.1 percent during",,,,,,,,,,
the past year.,,,,,,,,,,
All items less food and energy,,,,,,,,,,
The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.9 percent in the latest two-month period. Higher,,,,,,,,,,
"prices for apparel (12.0 percent), household furnishings and operations (2.3 percent) and shelter (0.7 percent)",,,,,,,,,,
were partially offset by lower prices for medical care (-1.6 percent) and recreation (-0.7 percent).,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the year, the index for all items less food and energy advanced 2.8 percent. Components contributing to",,,,,,,,,,
"the increase included medical care (5.1 percent), household furnishings and operations (3.7 percent) and",,,,,,,,,,
shelter (3.5 percent). Partly offsetting the increases were price decreases in education and communication and,,,,,,,,,,
"new and used motor vehicles, both down 0.8 percent).",,,,,,,,,,

Technical Note
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time in a fixed market
basket of goods and services. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes CPIs for two population groups: (1) a
CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) which covers approximately 94 percent of the total population and (2) a
CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) which covers 28 percent of the total population.
"The CPI-U includes, in addition to wage earners and clerical workers, groups such as professional, managerial,"
"and technical workers, the self-employed, short-term workers, the unemployed, and retirees and others not in"
the labor force.
"The CPI is based on prices of food, clothing, shelter, and fuels, transportation fares, charges for doctors' and"
"dentists' services, drugs, and the other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Each month,"
"prices are collected in 75 urban areas across the country from about 5,000 housing units and approximately"
"22,000 retail establishments--department stores, supermarkets, hospitals, filling stations, and other types of"
stores and service establishments. All taxes directly associated with the purchase and use of items are included
in the index.
The index measures price changes from a designated reference date (1982-84) that equals 100.0. An increase
"of 16.5 percent, for example, is shown as 116.5. This change can also be expressed in dollars as follows: the"
"price of a base period ""market basket"" of goods and services in the CPI has risen from $10 in 1982-84 to"
$11.65. For further details see the CPI home page on the Internet at www.bls.gov/cpi and the BLS Handbook
"of Methods, Chapter 17, The Consumer Price Index, available on the Internet at www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ "
homch17_a.htm.
"In calculating the index, price changes for the various items in each location are averaged together with"
weights that represent their importance in the spending of the appropriate population group. Local data are
"then combined to obtain a U.S. city average. Because the sample size of a local area is smaller, the local area"
index is subject to substantially more sampling and other measurement error than the national index. In
"addition, local indexes are not adjusted for seasonal influences. As a result, local area indexes show greater"
"volatility than the national index, although their long-term trends are quite similar. NOTE: Area indexes do"
not measure differences in the level of prices between cities; they only measure the average change in
prices for each area since the base period.
"The San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA. metropolitan area covered in this release is comprised of Alameda,"
"Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo Counties in the State of California."
